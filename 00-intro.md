An important aspect of "writing data for computers" is to make your data __tidy__ (see White et al and Wickham in the Resources). There's an emerging consensus on key features of __tidy__ data:

  * Each column is a variable
  * Each row is an observation

If you are struggling to make a figure, for example, stop and think hard about whether your data is __tidy__. Untidiness is an extremely common, often overlooked cause of unnecessary agony in data analysis and visualization.

## Lord of the Rings example

I will give you a concrete example of some untidy data I created from [this data from the Lord of the Rings Trilogy](https://github.com/jennybc/lotr).

We have one table per movie. In each table, I'm showing the total number of words spoken, by characters of different races and genders.

You could imagine finding these three tables as separate worksheets in an Excel workbook. Or snuggled up next to each other in a single worksheet. Or hanging out in some cells on the side of a worksheet that containing the underlying data raw data. Or as tables on a webpage or in a Word document.

In all cases, that data has been provided in a format designed for consumption by *human eyeballs* (paraphrasing Murrell; see Resources). The format makes it easy for a *human* to look up the number of words spoken by female elves in The Two Towers. But this format actually makes it pretty hard for a *computer* to pull out such counts and, more importantly, to compute on them or graph them.

## Exercises

Look at the 3 tables above and try to answer these questions:

  * What's the total number of words spoken by male hobbits?
  * Does a certain `Race` dominate a movie? Does the dominant `Race` differ across the movies?
  
How would you automate such a task if there were many more movies and/or `Races`?

## Tidy Lord of the Rings data

Here's how the same data looks in tidy form:

<!-- html table generated in R 3.1.0 by xtable 1.7-3 package -->
<!-- Wed Jul 23 16:07:09 2014 -->
<TABLE border=1>
<TR> <TH> Film </TH> <TH> Race </TH> <TH> Gender </TH> <TH> Words </TH>  </TR>

  <TR> <TD> The Two Towers </TD> <TD> Man </TD> <TD> M </TD> <TD align="right"> 3589 </TD> </TR>

  <TR> <TD> The Return Of The King </TD> <TD> Elf </TD> <TD> M </TD> <TD align="right"> 510 </TD> </TR>
  <TR> <TD> The Return Of The King </TD> <TD> Hobbit </TD> <TD> F </TD> <TD align="right"> 2 </TD> </TR>
  <TR> <TD> The Return Of The King </TD> <TD> Hobbit </TD> <TD> M </TD> <TD align="right"> 2673 </TD> </TR>
  <TR> <TD> The Return Of The King </TD> <TD> Man </TD> <TD> F </TD> <TD align="right"> 268 </TD> </TR>
  <TR> <TD> The Return Of The King </TD> <TD> Man </TD> <TD> M </TD> <TD align="right"> 2459 </TD> </TR>
   </TABLE>

Notice that tidy data is generally taller and narrower. Certain elements get repated alot, e.g. `Hobbit`. It doesn't "fit on a page" as nicely, so we often instinctively resist it. But, unless and until you're making the final product for a textual presentation of data, ignore your yearning to see the data in a compact form.

## Benefits of tidy data

With the data in tidy form, it's natural to *get a computer* to do further summarization or to make a figure. Let's answer the questions posed above.

#### What's the total number of words spoken by male hobbits?


```r
aggregate(Words ~ Race * Gender, data = lotr_tidy, FUN = sum)
```

```
##     Race Gender Words
## 1    Elf      F  1743
## 2 Hobbit      F    16
## 3    Man      F   669
## 4    Elf      M  1994
## 5 Hobbit      M  8780
## 6    Man      M  8043
```

Once we enlist a computer, it takes just one line of code to compute the word total for both genders of all `Races`. The total number of words spoken by male hobbits is 8780.

#### Does a certain `Race` dominate a movie? Does the dominant `Race` differ across the movies?

First, we sum across `Gender`, to obtain word counts for the different races by movie.




```r
(by_race_film <- aggregate(Words ~ Race * Film, data = lotr_tidy, FUN = sum))
```

```
##     Race                       Film Words
## 1    Elf The Fellowship Of The Ring  2200
## 2 Hobbit The Fellowship Of The Ring  3658
## 3    Man The Fellowship Of The Ring  1995
## 4    Elf             The Two Towers   844
## 5 Hobbit             The Two Towers  2463
## 6    Man             The Two Towers  3990
## 7    Elf     The Return Of The King   693
## 8 Hobbit     The Return Of The King  2675
## 9    Man     The Return Of The King  2727
```
We can start hard at those numbers to answer the question. But even nicer is to depict the word counts we just computed in a barchart. 


```r
library(ggplot2)
p <- ggplot(by_race_film, aes(x = Film, y = Words, fill = Race))
p + geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  coord_flip() + guides(fill = guide_legend(reverse=TRUE))
```

![plot of chunk barchart-lotr-words-by-film-race](./00-intro_files/figure-html/barchart-lotr-words-by-film-race.png) 

`Hobbits` are featured heavily in The Fellowhip of the Ring, where as `Men` had a lot more screen time in The Two Towers. They were equally prominent in the last movie, The Return of the King.

## Take home message

Having the data in __tidy__ form was a key enabler for our data aggregations and visualization.

Tidy data is integral to efficient data analysis and visualization.

If you're skeptical about any of the above claims, it would be interesting to get the requested word counts, the barchart, or the insight gained from the chart *without* tidying or plotting the data. And imagine redoing all of that on the full dataset, which includes 3 more `Races`, e.g. `Dwarves`.

### Where to next?

In the next lesson *will point to 00-tidy.Rmd when it exists*, we'll show how to tidy this data.

Our summing over `Gender` to get word counts for `Film * Race` was an example of __data aggregation__. The base function `aggregate()` does simple aggregation. For more flexibility, check out the packages `plyr` and `dplyr`. *point to other lessons when/if they exist?*

The figure was made with `ggplot2`, a popular package that implements the Grammar of Graphics in R.
